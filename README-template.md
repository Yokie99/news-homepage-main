Description: Complete the challenge of creating a front end based on the images and assets given to use and make the site responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile


Peer Reviewer: Ellie Rasuli
Review: 

Everything looks really good, here are just a few small details to fix about the website:

The little numbers on the lower bits look a little too high, and in the design the text is contained beside the images. Yours kinda spills out on top

Read More button should be at the bottom of the little segment it's in

The "Bright Future" text appears a bit too big

There is a little too much extra space at the bottom of the "New" column

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
